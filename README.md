# GridBayes (Grid-based Bayesian Mixed Effect Models)

GridBayes is an R package which is built on top of R packages qtl (Broman and others, 2003) and qtlbim (Yandell and others, 2007). 
The MCMC algorithm in C and the data manipulation procedure in R were modified for longitudinal analysis. 
The gridbayes package employs both DIC and simplified BPIC scores to select the optimal number of grid points.
